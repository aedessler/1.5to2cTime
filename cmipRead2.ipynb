For each model and each ensemble member within that model, concatenate the 'historical' and 'ssp245' data along the time dimension. Then, calculate the global average and the annual average of the 'tas' variable for each concatenated ensemble member. Store these annual global averages in a pandas DataFrame where the columns are named as 'model_name_ensemble_member' and the index is the year.
